        "explanation": "An advantage of derivatives is that they allow for greater liquidity as the low cash requirements for derivative transactions makes it more cost effective to enter into very large transactions. A disadvantage of derivatives is that the implicit leverage using derivatives contracts creates significantly more risk than their cash market equivalents. The ease of short sales with derivatives (e.g., selling a forward or futures contract) is an advantage compared to cash market transactions. With cash markets, difficulty in borrowing an asset and restrictions on short sales may make short positions in underlying assets problematic or more expensive. Low transaction costs, greater liquidity and leverage, and ease of short sales all make it less costly to exploit securities mispricing through derivatives transactions and improve the efficiency of market prices."

Therefore any firm that sells its output at less than the market price will decrease its total revenue. Under monopolistic competition or oligopoly, firms are price searchers.

In the long run, however, the firm should shut down unless the price is greater than average total cost.

The five forces that shape industry competition are rivalry among existing competitors, threat of entry, threat of substitutes, power of buyers, and power of suppliers. The stronger any of these forces are within an industry, the less potential that industry has to generate (or continue to earn) economic profits."

Because zero-coupon bonds have no coupons (all of the bond's return comes from price appreciation), investors have no uncertainty about the rate at which coupons will be invested. Spot rates are defined as interest rates used to discount a single cash flow to be received in the future. Any bond can be viewed as the sum of the present value of its individual cash flows where each of those cash flows are discounted at the appropriate zero-coupon bond spot rate."

As rate changes grow larger, the curvature of the bond price/yield relationship becomes more prevalent, meaning that a linear estimate of price changes will contain errors. The modified duration estimate is a linear estimate, as it assumes that the change is the same for each basis point change in required yield. The error in the estimate is due to the curvature of the actual price path. This is the degree of convexity. If we can generate a measure of this convexity, we can use this to improve our estimate of bond price changes."

One way that is accomplished is through the transfer of the underlying financial assets to a special purpose entity so that securities holders have clear legal claim to them, something they may not have if they were to invest only in the securities of the securitizer, such as a bank. Securitization does not have improved collectability as a primary benefit. Problem loans are not good candidates for securitization because institutional investors require a minimum credit quality and even well performing loans can require internal or external credit enhancement for the securitized assets."

Recourse loans are more favorable to the lender than non-recourse loans because with a non-recourse loan the lender can only reclaim the collateral in the event of default, while recourse gives the lender a claim against the borrower's other assets. The conversion option in a convertible mortgage is held by the borrower and is therefore attractive to a borrower rather than a lender."
